Data Set Information:

For Further information about the variables see the file in the data folder.


Attribute Information:

1. Node: This is the number of the sending node (numeric). 
2. Utilized Bandwidth Rate: This is the normalization of ‘Used_Bandidth’ (numeric). 
3. Packet Drop Rate: This is the normalization of ‘Percentage_Of_Lost_Pcaket_Rate’ (numeric). 
4. Reserved_Bandwidth: Initial reserved Bandwidth assigned (given) to each node, the user (usr) in the experiments assign these values. (numeric). 
5. Average_Delay_Time_Per_Sec: Average Delay Time (per second) for each node. This is (End-to End Delay). (numeric). 
6. Percentage_Of_Lost_Pcaket_Rate: Percentage of Packets Drop Rate for each node (numeric). 
7. Percentage_Of_Lost_Byte_Rate: Percentage of Lost Byte Rate for each node (numeric). 
8. Packet Received Rate: Total received packets (per second) for each node based on ‘Reserved_Bandwidth’ (numeric). 
9. Used_Bandwidth: This is what each node could reserve from the ‘Reserved_Bandwidth’ (numeric). 
10. Lost_Bandwidth: The amount of lost Bandwidth by each node from ‘Reserved_Bandwidth’ (numeric). 
11. Packet Size_Byte: Packets size in Byte assigned specifically for each node to transmit. Note: 60 Byte will be added to the 1440 for the IP Header and the UDP Header ((Data size 1440 Byte) + (IP Header 40 Byte) + (UDP Header 20 Byte)) =1500 Byte (numeric). 
12. Packet_Transmitted: Total transmitted packets (per second) for each node based on the ‘Reserved_Bandwidth’ (numeric). 
13. Packet_Received: Total received packets (per second) for each node based on the ‘Reserved_Bandwidth’ (numeric). 
14. Packet_lost: Total lost packets (per second) for each node, which based on the ‘Lost_Bandwidth’ (numeric). 
15. Transmitted_Byte: Total transmitted Byte (per second) for each node (numeric). 
16. Received_Byte: Total received Byte (per second) for each node based on the ‘Reserved_Bandwidth’ (numeric). 
17. 10-Run-AVG-Drop-Rate: Average packet drop rate for 10 consecutive (run) iterations (numeric). 
18. 10-Run-AVG-Bandwidth-Use: Average Bandwidth utilized for 10 consecutive (run) iterations (numeric). 
19. 10-Run-Delay: Average delay time for 10 consecutive (run) iterations (numeric). 
20. Node Status' {B, NB, P NB}: initial classification of nodes based on ‘Packet Drop Rate’, Used_Bandwidth and ‘Average_Delay_Time_Per_Sec’. B = Behaving, NB = Not Behaving and P NB = Potentially Not Behaving. (Categorical) 
21. Flood Status: Percentage of flood per node based on ‘Packet Drop Rate’ Medium and high level of BHP flood attack in case B (numeric). 
22. Class ' {NB-No Block, Block, No Block, NB-Wait}: The final classification of nodes based on ‘Packet Drop Rate’, ‘Reserved_Bandwidth’, ‘Iteration #’, ‘Used_Bandwidth’, ‘Packet Drop Rate’. This is for case B (Categorical ).
